REQ-3 is not implemented in the provided diff summary: QR/custom-card modules still exist and are still described as active in the repository summaries, indicating they were not removed/fully de-referenced from the build.",

      "requirement": "Remove unused QR/custom-card frontend modules and dependencies from the build after the UI is reverted (components, hooks, and imports related to custom QR credit cards and scanning).",
      "reason": "The diff shows QR/custom-card modules still present and the repository file summaries still describe them as implemented features (QR code via Google Charts, custom cards screen, QR scanner checkout panel). There is no evidence of these files being removed or fully de-referenced; only UI navigation/checkout selection appears reverted.",
