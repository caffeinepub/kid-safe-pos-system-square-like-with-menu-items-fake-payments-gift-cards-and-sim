  "summary": "The diff shows frontend UI tweaks (layout/header/footer, favicon/title) and improved menu React Query hooks with clearer errors when the backend actor is not initialized. However, there is no concrete evidence in the diff of fixing the actual deploy/publish failure or producing a working shareable deployed URL, and the required image assets are referenced but not added.",

      "reason": "The diff only shows frontend component/hook changes and metadata updates. There is no evidence of changes to deployment configuration, build tooling, canister settings, or backend code that would directly address publish/deployment failure or guarantee a shareable deployed URL.",
